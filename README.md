## Hello GitHub!

I'm Hansen (he/him) , an aspiring ML Engineer with a B.S. Physics and in pursuit of M.S. Computer Science, AI and Machine Learning. 

My interest in ML began in my undergraduate research position at NYIT where I studied neutrino flavor oscillation in cosmic events such as core collapse supernovae. Although we did not use ML algorithms specifically, my work in this field sparked an interest in general algorithms, which led to my discover of Machine Learning.

On my GitHub profile, I plan to keep track of my progress in coding, AI/ML, and publish any projects that may contribute to establishing my career.
